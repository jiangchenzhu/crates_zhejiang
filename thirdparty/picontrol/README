Instructions
------------

1. Make sure that you have successfully built CRATES and that you have 'sourced'
   the devel environment. i.e. 'source /path/to/crates/devel/setup.bash'
2. Compile the example code in a terminal:
   > mkdir build
   > cd build
   > cmake ..
   > make
3. Switch to a second terminal and run the CRATES simulator
   > roslaunch sim sw.launch
4. Return to your original terminal and run the example
   > ./example

The code will pause the simulation, insert a quadrotor and run the simulator.
The position of the quadrotor will be published at 1Hz to the console.

PI Control
----------

1.	For simulation, run init_muav from the build directory.
		This will insert the quadrotors

	> ./init_muav ../pi_UAV_joint.xml

2.	Once the quadrotors are visible, run main_muav 

	> ./main_muav ../pi_UAV_joint.xml

3.	To turn on/off noise call

	> rosservice call /simulator/Noise true
